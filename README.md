# twitter-clone

## Description
A clone of the social media platform, Twitter, with a few personal design twists. 

## Visuals
The mockup I'll be working off of for the project, created in Figma. Of course, as time goes on, I will invetiablly mockup new features (and implement them), albeit, this is great base for the feed portion of the web-app. 
### Feed Page

## Installation 
You can install the app by cloning the repository, and starting a server with npm. You will need to create your own database solution, I used firebase.
```
git clone https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/twitter-clone 
npm install react-bootstrap
npm install react-firebase-hooks/auth
npm install firebase
npm start
```

## Roadmap
I'll be working on this for the next few weeks, most of the front-end design for the feed is done (HTML/CSS), what remains, is implementing it via React, and linking it to a backend. 
- [X] Front-end: React.js, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS
- [X] Back-end: Firebase (OAuth2 & Firestore), Node.js
